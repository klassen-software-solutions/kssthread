// This file is a re-write of the earlier "Processor" class to make use of the C++11 async
// call. As part of this we have dropped the sequential portions of the class and have
// replaced the parallel portions with a single "parallel" function. This function runs
// all the actions it is given using async, then waits for all the futures to complete
// before returning. (To give an idea of the benefit of this re-write, the original code
// written in 2003 was over 400 lines long, possibly less efficient in its use of threads,
// and much more difficult to use.)

         The key advantage of this over the other parallel() method, is that there is
         significantly less overhead compared to the async() method which generates
         a new thread with each call.

         This version of parallel() should be preferred if you are calling small actions
         many times so as to minimize the creation and destruction of the threads.

         threads. (One of the actions will run in the current thread.)
